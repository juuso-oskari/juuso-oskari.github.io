title: About Me
---
I am a MSc. in Computer Science from Aalto University with a deep learning major. I have extensive knowledge and passion for the whole deep learning stack from framework to algorithm development. I'm interested in creating efficient algorithms for computer vision problems, such as novel-view-synthesis and SLAM. Recently I've been doing R&D in speeding up and compressing NeRF and 3D gaussian splatting models, and exploring PyTorch internals and deep learning compilers such as TVM.

If you are interested in working with me, please contact via *<juusokorhoin@gmail.com>*.

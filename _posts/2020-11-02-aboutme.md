title: About Me
---
I am a MSc. in computer science from Aalto university with a deep learning major. I'm interested in creating efficient solutions for computer vision problems such as novel-view-synthesis, SLAM and image/video compression. Recently I've been doing R&D in speeding up and compressing NeRF and 3D gaussian splatting models, and exploring PyTorch internals.

I'm looking for a job so if you are interested, contact me via *<juusokorhoin@gmail.com>*.

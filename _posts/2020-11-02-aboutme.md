title: About Me
---
I am a MSc. in Computer Science from Aalto University with a deep learning major. I have extensive knowledge and passion for the whole deep learning stack from framework to algorithm development. Currently, I'm working at Nokia as a Visual AI intern until June 5th. My tasks there include NeRF, image and video compression, and computer vision.

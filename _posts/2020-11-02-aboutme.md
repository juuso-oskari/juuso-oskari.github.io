title: About Me
---
I am a MSc. in Computer Science from Aalto University with a deep learning major. My interests include efficient algorithm development in Computer Vision with models such as NeRF/3DGS and image/video compression. Recently I've been delving into deep learning frameworks and compilers (PyTorch internals, TVM).

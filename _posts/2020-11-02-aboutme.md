title: About Me
---
I am a MSc. in Computer Science from Aalto University with a deep learning major. I have extensive knowledge and passion for the whole deep learning stack from framework to algorithm development. Currently, I'm working at Nokia as a Visual AI intern until June 5th. My tasks there include applying deep learning to image and video compression, and computer vision with models such as NeRFs.

If you are interested in working with me, please contact via *<juusokorhoin@gmail.com>*.

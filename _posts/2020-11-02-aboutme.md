---
I am currently a joint Ph.D. candidate of **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn)** and **[Monash University](https://www.monash.edu)** from [SEIEE](https://www.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn) since 2021, 
working with [Prof. Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io), [Prof. Jianfei Cai](https://jianfei-cai.github.io) and [Prof. Mehrtash Harandi](https://sites.google.com/site/mehrtashharandi/).
Before that, I spent 4 wonderful years studying at **[Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn)** as an undergraduate student since 2017.
My research interests include NeRF/3DGS compression, image/video compression and computer vision.
I am also happy to share my good friend Qianyi Wu's fantastic works [here](https://qianyiwu.github.io). 

If you are interested in my work, please contact me via *<yhchen.ee@sjtu.edu.cn>*.
